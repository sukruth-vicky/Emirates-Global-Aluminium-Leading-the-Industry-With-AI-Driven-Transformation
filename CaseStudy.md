Emirates Global Aluminium, one of the world’s largest aluminium producers, began an ambitious AI-driven transformation to modernize its operations and strengthen global competitiveness. 
The company operates in a high-volume, energy-intensive industry where small performance improvements generate significant impact. 
McKinsey and Company partnered with EGA to redesign operations, apply artificial intelligence at scale, and improve workforce capability.

EGA faced challenges common to heavy industrial settings. Variations in operating conditions, manual decision-making, inconsistent data quality, and limited predictive capabilities meant that efficiency and output were not always optimized. 
The company wanted a more advanced way to control its potlines, reduce emissions, improve safety, and strengthen productivity.

The transformation focused on deploying AI models to assist operators in making real-time decisions. 
EGA built custom AI tools based on historical potline data, refining the models to predict instability, optimize heat balance, and reduce energy waste. 
The implementation required deep coordination among engineers, frontline teams, and data specialists.

A key part of the approach was capability building. EGA trained employees through a dedicated academy, helping them understand machine-learning fundamentals and how to use AI recommendations in daily operations. 
This alignment between technology and talent allowed EGA to embed AI deeply into workflows rather than as an isolated tool.

The impact was substantial. AI-driven recommendations improved stability, reduced manual interventions, and enhanced process control. 
Operators gained more confidence in decision-making, while leadership saw measurable improvements in output, efficiency, and safety. 
The project demonstrated how AI can modernize industrial systems and create lasting operational advantage when paired with strong capability building.

EGA’s journey highlights how an industrial company can become a global leader in AI adoption by combining technical excellence, strong data foundations, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous learning.
